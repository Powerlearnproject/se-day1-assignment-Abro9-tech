#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products. Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a)Development of programming languages (1950s-1970s)
    fortran(1957)-one of the earliest programming languages, fortran was pivital in enabling engineers to write programmes without needing detailed knowledge of machine code
    c(1972)-c introduced a powerful combination of efficiency and portability.
b)the development of software engineering as a discpline in the 1960s.
c)The advent of structured programming languages in 1970s-structured programming emerged as a paradigm to improve code clarity and reduce complexity.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
the software development lifecycle include:
Requirements-gathering user needs and system requirements
Design-creating a detailed design of the software articture and user interface
implementation-writing code and building the software according to the specification and user interface
Testing-conducting various test to ensure that the system meets the functionality requirements and quality standards
Deployement-releasing the software to the user
Maintainance-providing ongoing support, updates and enforcement to the system after deployement


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases(e.g requirements, design, implementation) flowing like a waterfall while Agile is iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
Agile methodology is best for projects with evolving requirements and need for rapid updates( e.g new software prodcts.
Waterfall  methodology is best for projects with stable requirements and fixed deadlines
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

software developer-responsible for writing codes and developing software solutions
A quality Assuarance Engineer-ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
project manager-oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Software engineering tools enhance productivity, collaboration, and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control, debugging tools, and automated testing capabilities.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

a)Complex Requirements-Understanding and managing complex requirements can lead to scope creep and project failure.
Strategy: Implement thorough requirements gathering and stakeholder communication. Use techniques like user stories and acceptance criteria to clarify expectations.

b)Rapid technology changes-Keeping up with the fast pace of technological advancements can be daunting.
Strategy: Commit to continuous learning through online courses, workshops, and conferences. Encourage team members to share knowledge through regular meetups.

c)Testing and Quality Assurance:Ensuring thorough testing can be time-consuming, and missed bugs can lead to production issues.
Strategy: Incorporate automated testing and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices. Create a testing culture within the team, emphasizing the importance of quality.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing-testing individual components or modules of software
integration testing-testing intergrations between different components or subsystems.
system testing-testing the entire software system as a whole
acceptance testing-testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the process of designing and refining prompts or input queries used to interact with language models, especially in the context of AI and machine learning applications, such as text generation, conversation systems, and other applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It focuses on crafting prompts that lead to desired outputs by influencing how the model interprets the input.It helps improve the interaction between humans and AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a Vague Prompt
Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about space."

Improved Prompt
Improved Prompt:
"Explain the differences between red dwarfs and blue giants, including their characteristics, lifespans, and roles in stellar evolution."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective
the improved prompt gives the model a clear direction and scope, which is likely to result in a more focused, relevant, and useful output, better catering to the user's needs.
